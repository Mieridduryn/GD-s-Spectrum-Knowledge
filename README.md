# GD's Spectrum Knowledge
 A bunch of Markdown files explaining the Spectrum mod and its mechanics. SPOILERS!

 I forget things. This is a repo of my knowledge, and the knowledge of others who wish to contribute.

 There's no English wiki for Spectrum. Sad.

 Anyway. Spectrum is a magic mod based on the CMYK (pigment) color mixing model. It is a mod by and for gay furries, created by Dafuqsy and Azzyy.
