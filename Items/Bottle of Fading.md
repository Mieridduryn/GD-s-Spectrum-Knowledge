# WARNING: DO NOT UNLEASH THIS IN A FOREST UNLESS YOU WANT TO CLEAN IT UP. A VEIN MINER MOD SUCH AS FTB ULTIMINE IS HIGHLY ADVISABLE TO HAVE INSTALLED WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH FADING, FAILING, AND RUIN!

The **Fading** is the first of the three grey goo-like organisms in bottles that you can craft with the [Pigment Pedestal] in Survival mode. It requires the Spectrum Focus/CMY upgrade.

The Fading spreads from a block you place by right-clicking with the Bottle of Fading in your hand.

The Fading eats leaves, melons, pumpkins, and hay bales. It will not eat carved pumpkins.
